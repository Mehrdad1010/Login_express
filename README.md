Design a login page that allows the user to check the correctness of their input information. See the form where the user enters the username and password and clicks on the submit button. The entered information is sent to the server with the help of Post Request and after comparing them with the data of the Jason file, the server gives the appropriate answer to the client and the client displays it to the user in the appropriate ways.
